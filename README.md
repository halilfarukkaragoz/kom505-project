# Life of a Disease: A Markov Chain Model for Epidemics via Social Graphs
## Overview
"Life of a Disease: A Markov Chain Model for Epidemics via Social Graphs" is a comprehensive project that explores the application of Markov chain models and graph theory in understanding the spread of diseases in populations. By representing individuals as nodes in a graph and their interactions as edges with probabilistic weights, this project offers insights into how different interaction rates and health states affect the lifecycle of an epidemic.

## Features
Graph-Based Modeling: Incorporates a graph representation where nodes symbolize individuals, and edges represent potential disease transmission pathways.
Markov Chain Approach: Utilizes Markov chains to simulate the spread of diseases, taking into account varying transmission probabilities.
State Transition Matrix: Includes a detailed matrix depicting the potential transitions in health states within the population.
Comprehensive Analysis: Features an in-depth analysis of disease progression under various scenarios, highlighting the influence of interaction probabilities and other key factors.
## Results
This project provides an analytical perspective on the spread of diseases, underlining the significance of interaction probabilities and other critical parameters in influencing the dynamics of an epidemic. It offers valuable insights that could inform public health strategies and disease control measures.
